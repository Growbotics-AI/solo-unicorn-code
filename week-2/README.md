Welcome to Week 2 of the **One-Person Unicorn Experiment**. This week, we delve into the development of a multi-agent system and the initial stages of creating a mapping application that identifies and integrates local manufacturing networks crucial for supporting robotics in small-scale agriculture.

## Assignments Overview

This week, our exploration is divided into two main assignments, detailed in separate directories. Follow the links below for technical details and code for each assignment:

- [**Assignment 1: Enhance CrewAI for Autonomous Research**](assignment-1/)
  - **Objective**: Upgrade the CrewAI framework to manage multiple research tasks autonomously. Implement a Telegram-based interaction mechanism that allows the AI crew to communicate in real-time, compiling and sharing findings directly on GitHub in markdown format.

- [**Assignment 2: Map Local Manufacturing Networks**](assignment-2/)
  - **Objective**: Initiate the process of gathering data on local manufacturers and other vital entities. This task focuses on creating a decentralized network of resources, identifying potential partners, and understanding their capabilities and roles in enhancing small-scale agriculture with technology.
