## Progress Update

### Developed Interactive Map

The interactive map has been developed using the Next.js framework, specifically leveraging the `leaflet-nextjs-ts-starter` template by Richard Unterberg. This choice provides a robust foundation for the integration of mapping functionalities.

### Custom Icons

To enhance map readability and aesthetics, custom icons have been created for various entities such as Digital Manufacturing Facilities, Assemblers, and Local Businesses. These icons were crafted using AI tools like Midjourney and DALLÂ·E 3 and have been integrated into the application as React components.

## Next Immediate Steps

- **Deploy**: Immediate deployment of the application on Vercel is planned to ensure ease of access and to maintain high availability.
- **Sidebar Functionality**: We will add functionality to toggle the sidebar, thus improving the user interface.
- **API Integration**: The Overpass API will be integrated to import detailed geospatial data from OpenStreetMap, enhancing the map's utility with accurate, real-time data.
- **Populate Data**: The next phase involves populating the map with real-world data to make the information provided both accurate and practical for users.
- **Business Interaction**: New features will be introduced to allow businesses to claim their listings on the map and detail their digital manufacturing services.
