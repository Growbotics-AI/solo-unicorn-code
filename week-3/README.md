Welcome to Week 3 of the **One-Person Unicorn Experiment**. This week focuses on further developing the interactive mapping application and enhancing the functionality of the Infinity Crew for autonomous operations.

## Mapping Application Enhancements

The interactive map now includes new features for better navigation and location-based functionalities. It has been deployed at [Growbotics AI Map](https://maps.growbotics.ai/), integrating location-based services through Nominatim and user IP location detection via ipinfo.io.

## Infinity Crew Setup

Enhancements include an updated communication and AI interface, and a new API for efficient crew operations. This setup allows the Infinity Crew to autonomously manage tasks and respond to queries dynamically.
