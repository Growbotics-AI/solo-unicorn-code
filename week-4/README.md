Welcome to Week 4 of the **One-Person Unicorn Experiment**. This week, the focus has been on deploying the map application and Infinity Crew services using Docker and Cloudflare Tunnels to improve deployment efficiency and manageability.

## Map Application Enhancements

The map application now uses a Places API to pull location data from the database, which enhances its functionality by providing more accurate and relevant data to users.

## Infinity Crew Developments

This week's work on the Infinity Crew involved integrating various components into a cohesive application that supports a Telegram chat interface and the CrewAI agents. This allows the application to interact with users through the Llama 3 70B model, enabling them to ask questions or assign tasks.
