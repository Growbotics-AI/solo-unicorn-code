## [Infinity Crew](infinity_crew.py)
Currently implemented in a single file, this system simulates a crew management setup with three agents: Major Tom, Ziggy Stardust, and Starman. Each agent has specific roles and goals, working together to execute tasks. The file includes integration with a Telegram bot, CrewAI functionalities, and a FastAPI setup. Plans are in place to restructure this into a structured Python project next week to improve manageability and scalability.
