Welcome to Week 6 of the **One-Person Unicorn Experiment**. This week, we explore new AI capabilities and reflect on insights from the ICLR 2024 conference.

## Places API Enhancements

Significant progress was made on the Places API, which now retrieves data from a MySQL database, allowing for efficient geospatial queries. The enhanced HTTP API interacts with this database, and the setup is deployed locally using Docker Compose, accessible via a Cloudflare tunnel. These updates make the Places API more dynamic and responsive.
